    <p>Hi my name is Bob, and I am the guitarist of the group. I have been playing guitar for over 40 years.  I first started after I enrolled in a beginner’s guitar course in elementary school.  My passions include biking, skiing, and, of course, playing music with the band.  I also enjoy collecting cool antique guitars.  One of my favorites in my collection is a one-thousand-year old lute.</p>

    <p>Hey fans, my name is Robert, and I am the drummer of the band.   A lot of people ask me, “Rob, how did you get so good on the drums?”  And I always tell them, “Practice and hard work haha.”  I have been playing real drums for about a year or so now, I previously only played the drum edition of guitar hero.  I guess it all worked out though…  Anyways, I enjoy traveling, playing go fish, and photography.  I am also currently learning how to code in a really neat web design class. It’s probably one of the best classes I’ve ever taken haha!  Anyways, can’t wait to see all my fans at the concert!</p>

    <p>Hello my esteemed fans, I am known as Erick, the lead kazooist of The shtick.  As an aspiring master kazooist, I make it my religion to practice kazoo for 25 hours a day. My kazoo is not just an instrument; it is a lifestyle.  Since the creation of the band, I have invented the never before seen electric kazoo. I plan on creating an improved atomic kazoo by the time our tour ends.  Thank you very much, and enjoy the tour.</p>

    <p>Whats poppin fam, my name is Memelord, Destroyer of Worlds, and I am the singer of the group. I have always enjoyed music, however ever since I lost my left thumb, it has become difficult to play instruments.  So I decided to take up the instrument of my own voice.  I have been singing for over a millennia, and I expect to continue to until I die.  So I guess ill talk a little about the things I like.  I really enjoy fishing, swimming, and basketball.  My favorite food is macaroni and cheese.  Also my favorite color is green.  I am also very involved in the politics of my city, running for mayor two times, receiving over .12% of the vote total.  I am very excited for the rest of the tour!</p>
